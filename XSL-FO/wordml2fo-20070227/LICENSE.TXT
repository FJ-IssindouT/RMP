4.	PRE-RELEASE PRODUCT ADDITIONAL TERMS

If the product you have received with this license is pre-commercial
release or beta Software ("Pre-release Software"), then this Section
applies.  To the extent that any provision in this Section is in conflict
with any other term or condition in this Agreement, this Section shall
supersede such other term(s) and condition(s) with respect to the
Pre-release Software, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the
conflict.  You acknowledge that the Software is a pre-release version,
does not represent final product from RENDERX, and may contain bugs,
errors and other problems that could cause system or other failures and
data loss.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU
"AS-IS", AND RENDERX DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS
TO YOU OF ANY KIND EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.	WHERE LEGALLY LIABILITY CANNOT
BE EXCLUDED FOR PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE, BUT IT MAY BE LIMITED, RENDERX'S
LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SUM OF FIFTY
DOLLARS (U.S.$50) IN TOTAL.  You acknowledge that RENDERX has not promised
or guaranteed to you that Pre-release Software will be announced or made
available to anyone in the future, that RENDERX has no express or implied
obligation to you to announce or introduce the Pre-release Software and
that RENDERX may not introduce a product similar to or compatible with
the Pre-release Software.  Accordingly, you acknowledge that any research
or development that you perform regarding the Pre-release Software or
any product associated with the Pre-release Software is done entirely
at your own risk.  During the term of this Agreement, if requested by
RENDERX, you will provide feedback to RENDERX regarding testing and use
of the Pre-release Software, including error or bug reports.  If you have
been provided the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written
agreement, your use of the Software is governed by such agreement.
You may not sublicense, lease, loan, rent, distribute or otherwise
transfer the Pre-release Software.  Upon receipt of a later unreleased
version of the Pre-release Software or release by RENDERX of a publicly
released commercial version of the Software, whether as a stand-alone
product or as part of a larger product, you agree to return or destroy
all earlier Pre-release Software received from RENDERX and to abide by
the terms of the license agreement for any such later versions of the
Pre-release Software.

5.	WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

(a)Limited Warranty. RENDERX warrants that (a) the Software will perform
substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials for
a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of receipt,
and (b) any support services provided by RENDERX shall be substantially
as described in applicable written materials provided to you by RENDERX,
and RENDERX support engineers will make commercially reasonable efforts
to solve any problem issues. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow
limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation
may not apply to you. To the extent allowed by applicable law, implied
warranties on the Software, if any, are limited to one hundred and eighty
(180) days.

(b)XSL-FO Issues.  In addition to the limitations on the obligations of
Licensor to correct bugs or other defects in the Software, Licensor
shall have no obligation to correct any failure of the Software
to interpret data in XSL-FO formats if that data contains errors or
other defects.	The parties understand that errors or defects may also
appear in other computer programs which may interact with the Software,
and that Licensor shall have no obligation or liability with respect
to such defects or errors in those computer programs.  When notifying
Licensor of a perceived defect in the Software, Licensee agrees that it
shall provide Licensor with any input data that Licensee has attempted to
convert sufficient for Licensor to replicate the defect.  Licensor shall
have no obligations to implement any XSL-FO features not specifically
mentioned in this Agreement.

(c)Customer Remedies. RENDERX's and its suppliers' entire liability and
your exclusive remedy shall be, at RENDERX's option, either (a) return of
the price paid, if any, or (b) repair or replacement of the Software that
does not meet RENDERX's Limited Warranty and which is returned to RENDERX
with a copy of your receipt. This Limited Warranty is void if failure
of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse or misapplication. Any
replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original
warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.

(d)No Other Warranties. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, RENDERX AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND
CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, INFORMATIONAL CONTENT OR ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, TITLE
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE, AND THE PROVISION
OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY
GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH VARY FROM
STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.

(e)Limitation Of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL RENDERX OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS
PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY
OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE
SOFTWARE OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, EVEN
IF RENDERX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY
CASE, RENDERX'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU
FOR THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR U.S.$50.00; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE
ENTERED INTO AN RENDERX SUPPORT SERVICES AGREEMENT, RENDERX'S ENTIRE
LIABILITY REGARDING SUPPORT SERVICES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF
THAT AGREEMENT. Because some states and jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of liability, the above limitation may not apply
to you.  In such states and jurisdictions, RENDERX's liability shall be
limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

(f)Infringement Claims.   RENDERX will indemnify and hold you harmless
and will defend or settle any claim, suit or proceeding brought against
you that is based upon a claim that the content contained in the Software
infringes a copyright or violates an intellectual or proprietary right
protected by United States or European Union law ("Claim"), but only
to the extent the Claim arises directly out of the use of the Software.
You must notify RENDERX in writing of any Claim within ten (10) business
days after you first receive notice of the Claim, and you shall provide
to RENDERX at no cost with such assistance and cooperation as RENDERX may
reasonably request from time to time in connection with the defense of
the Claim.  RENDERX shall have sole control over any Claim (including,
without limitation, the selection of counsel and the right to settle on
your behalf on any terms RENDERX deems desirable in the sole exercise of
its discretion). You may, at your sole cost, retain separate counsel and
participate in the defense or settlement negotiations. RENDERX shall
pay actual damages and costs awarded against you (or payable by you
pursuant to a settlement agreement) in connection with a Claim to the
extent such damages and costs are not reimbursed to you by insurance
or a third party, to an aggregate maximum of US$1,000. If the Software
or its use becomes the subject of a Claim or its use is enjoined, or
if in the opinion of RENDERX's legal counsel the Software is likely
to become the subject of a Claim, RENDERX shall attempt to resolve the
Claim by using commercially reasonable efforts to modify the Software
or obtain a license to continue using the Software. If in the opinion
of RENDERX's legal counsel the Claim, the injunction or potential Claim
cannot be resolved through reasonable modification or licensing, RENDERX,
at its own election, may terminate this Agreement without penalty,
and will refund to you on a pro rata basis any fees paid in advance by
you to RENDERX. THE FOREGOING CONSTITUTES RENDERX'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
LIABILITY FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.

6.	TERM AND TERMINATION

This Agreement may be terminated (a) by your giving RENDERX written notice
of termination; or (b) by RENDERX, at its option, giving you written
notice of termination if you commit a breach of this Agreement and fail
to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after notice from RENDERX.
Upon any termination of this Agreement, you must cease all use of the
Software, destroy all copies then in your possession or control and take
such other actions as RENDERX may reasonably request to ensure that no
copies of the Software remain in your possession or control.
